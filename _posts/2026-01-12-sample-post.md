This is a sample post added to demonstrate the `_posts/` filename and front-matter conventions used by this repository.

- Keep the filename date prefix in sync with the `date:` field in front matter.
- Use `layout: post` for blog posts so `_layouts/post.html` controls rendering.

Enjoy publishing!
